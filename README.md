## Application Overview

# Root User View
<li>
Root users have the capability to establish companies and designate their admin users, granting client companies system access. They have the power to enable or disable companies. When a company is disabled, its users lose access to the system.
</li>

## Invoices
<li>
Admins create invoices for purchases or sales. The app auto-generates numbers and dates for these invoices. Purchase invoices boost stock, while sales invoices reduce it. Stocks update only after a manager approves an invoice. The system blocks sales invoices for products lacking enough stock, preventing sales of unavailable items. Any Invoice can be printed after approval.

## Reporting

On the profit and loss page, admins view monthly financial outcomes. The product profit and loss page shows each item's performance. The stock report tracks inventory adjustments. The dashboard displays the company's total costs, sales, and overall financial health.
